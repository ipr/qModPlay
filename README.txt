A (tracker) module player with Qt&C++

Purpose/goals:

1. Somewhat portable implementation for playing tracker modules:
some are only playable with emulated m68k code now, 
some players/plugins are even expecting Amiga sound-chip (Paula) emulation as well..

2. Simple to maintain/extend:
sources available, (somewhat) clean&simple code/structure etc.

3. 

Note: large parts _will_ be used from other GPL-licensed apps like xmp and uade
but rewritten/refractored for my tastes anyway.. Maybe fix a bug or two while at it..

Licensing:
GPL (v2/v3?)

(TODO)
